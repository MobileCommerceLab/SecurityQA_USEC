Inquiries about commercial licensing should be directed to Prof. Norman Sadeh (sadeh@cs.cmu.edu). If you use the corpus (i.e., the questions, generated answers, or both) toward a publication, you must cite the following paper:

The above paper is also important for understanding the contents of the corpus, and the collection of questions and answers. The full paper can be found at www.usableprivacy.org/static/files/duesterwald_2024.pdf

### Overview:

This corpus contains 1,045 questions about every day cybersecurity that were asked by participants in an in situ user study. Each of these questions has two answers automatically generated by GPT 4: one answer with extra prompt engineering (for specific details about the prompt engineering, see the paper above) and one answer without extra prompt engineering. This data is formatted as a .csv file (security_qa_questions_and_answers.csv) with three columns: **question_asked**, **answer_with_prompt_engineering**, and **answer_no_prompt_engineering**.

1. **question_asked**: the original question asked by the study participant.
2. **answer_with_prompt_engineering**: the answer generated by GPT 4 to the asked question when extra prompt engineering was applied to the question.
3. **answer_no_prompt_engineering**: the answer generated by GPT 4 to the asked question without extra prompt engineering applied to the question.

Each row of the .csv file represents one question, and its corresponding answers both with and without extra prompt engineering.
